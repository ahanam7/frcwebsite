    <h1>Meet Our Mentors!</h1>
        <p>Mentors are the backbone of Team 7230. They are professionals, educators, alumni, and community members who volunteer their time to guide and support our students.
             While students lead the design, building, and decision-making, mentors provide technical knowledge, safety oversight, career insight, and real-world experience.</p>
        <p>Team 7230 is proud to be a student-driven team with mentor support that empowers our journey.</p>
